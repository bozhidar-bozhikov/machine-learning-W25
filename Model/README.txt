because the dataset file size(s) is too large we cannot upload it to GitHub. 
as such, you need to download it locally and place it in the correct pathing

1. download the dataset from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765

2. extract the zip file so the file structure looks like this:
machine-learning-W25
└── Model
	├── PetImages
	│	├── Cat/
	│	└── Dog/
	└── binary_classifier.py (and other files)
